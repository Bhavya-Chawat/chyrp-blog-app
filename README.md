# üåå Chyrp ‚Äî Modern Blogging Platform  
_A next-generation, modular, and extensible blogging platform inspired by the classic Chyrp engine, rebuilt for the modern web._

***

## Project Overview  
Chyrp Modernized transforms the classic Chyrp blogging engine into a cutting-edge, API-driven full-stack web application. Powered by Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase, it delivers a fast, responsive, and modular platform for bloggers. Featuring real-time updates, multiple rich content types (‚ÄúFeathers‚Äù), advanced UI/UX designs with cyberpunk aesthetics, and a secure authentication system, Chyrp is tailored for flexibility, interactivity, and modern web standards.

- Code splitting and dynamic imports for faster load times  
- Incremental Static Regeneration and API route caching  
- Secure authentication via Supabase Auth with social login (GitHub, Google) and magic link  
- Spam prevention with MAPTCHA integration for form security  
- Edge-ready deployment on Vercel for global fast delivery  

### Extensibility & Architecture
